            <h1>Purpose Statement </h1>
            <p>The Star Wars universe first entered the scene 43 years ago with the release of the first film, at the time simply titled Star Wars but know known as A New Hope.
                In the ensuing years Star Wars has cemented itself as a global pop-cultural icon that has touched the lives of millions.
                Despite this, most people have failed to understand that the Empire in general and Emperor Palpatine in particular are not actually villains but rather the true unsung heros of the saga.
                I've created this website to correct the record on Palpatine. My hope is that I can put to an end the shameful slander his character has undergone and spread the true light of Palpatines greatness to the masses.
            </p>

/* Media Query Styles */

/*M5LO4 Use CSS for pull-down menus (or collapsible/expandable areas) (CSS, note where the menu is on your site and how it behaves): 
M5LO4 demonstrated by application of the xyz style rules nested within the @media rule below. Pull-down functionality was not added to 
site navigation because this site does not have navigation submenus. Pull-down (collapsible/expandable) functionality was added to the table located on 
the post-empire.html page instead. Also, please note that a max-width of 550px rather than the typical 480px because 480px 
was not sufficient to trigger xyz rules when emulating several of the smartphones available to emulate using the Microsoft Edge browser. */


/*M5LO3 Use media queries to format a page differently for phones vs. PCs. (CSS, note where these are in your CSS and describe the overall impact they have on the site):
  M5LO3 demonstrated by the table rule nested within the @media rule below. At widths above 550px, the table with the classification .t-able (the second table on the post-empire.html page)
  has a style rule setting its width to 50% of the page body. This width was chosen for astheic reasons. However at smaller resolutions the 50% width limitations makes the table
  harder content much harder to read. The below style rule increases the table width to 95% of the body at resolutions below 550px to enhance readability.
  I used the Microsoft Edge browser device emulator to verify this rule worked as intended using multiple mobile devices available for Emulation in Edge. 
  Also, please note 550px was used instead of 480px to enable functionality of @media rule on all of the emulator's phones. */

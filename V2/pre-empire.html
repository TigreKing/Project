            <h1>Early Life</h1>
                <p>Unfortunately, little information remains of Palpatine's early life following extensive cleansing campaigns carried out by the New Republic Ministries of Truth and Love following their usurpation of the Galactic Empire.
                   Nevertheless several documents have survived to present day due to the work of a few brave historians. It is thanks to these historians that the following information can be shared with the Galaxy.
                   Palpatine, full name Sheev Palpatine, was born to the wealthy and political connected Palpatine family of Naboo approximately 80 years before millions of stormtroopers were martyred during the destruction of the first Death Star at the Battle of Yavin.
                   From an early age Palpatine understood, despite the wealth and privilege he'd been born into, that the current system of government was entirely corrupt. 
                   After all, in a just galaxy no child would have been saddled with a rediculous name like Sheev. Palpatine swore that he would prevent any other child from being cursed with such a silly first name ever again.
                   He bore the ultimate burden so that all the people might be saved. And so he bided his time, learning the ins and outs of politics, slowly rising up the ranks in local Naboo politics.
                   It was during these early years that he first attracted the attention of Darth Plagueis, a member of the persecuted Sith minority relgious group. 
                   Plagueis, like Palpatine, felt a great love for all life in the galaxy. So much so in fact, that Plagueis had spent years of his life devoted towards researching arcane force techniques that could finally free living beings from the ultimate cruelty, death itself.
                   This quest for eternal life was in fact how Plagueis decided upon his nom de guerre, almost as if to laugh in the face of the various poxes and plagues that had stolen many a life tragically young. 
                   Plagueis recognized in Palpatine that same love of life and selfless sense of duty he shared, and so resolved to take him up as an apprentice.
                   With such a close bond between master and apprentice, one can surely imagine the deep sense of loss Palpatine felt when Plagueis died in a tragic boating accident shortly after Palpatine's training in the Sith arts had been completed. 
                   In a remarkable coincidence, the sitting Naboo Senator for the Old Republic Senate also died in an equally tragic boating accident shortly thereafter, leaving the seat vacant. 
                   While Palpatine was a humble man who did not seek power or glory, he was ultimately elected to the vacant Senate seat after he won over 100% of the vote in a Naboo wide electoral write-in campaign.
